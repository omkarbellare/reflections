When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Keeping a remote repository allows people to collaborate on the same project and allows everyone to contribute to it. This is very helpful in open-source projects, where anyone can help in improving code by fixing bugs and adding new features.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would like to manually pull the code because I wouldn't want my local copy to change due to a change in the remote while I am working on a local. If there is a bug in the remote, I would like to wait for the bug to be fixed before pulling in the new version of the code.
